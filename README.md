# Pathfinder
A web app to visualise pathfinding algorithms. Built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
All you need to do to get started is to click on the Source, place it on a cell in the grid, and do the same with the Destination. You may also add obstacles by selecting Obstacle and then proceeding to click and drag on the grid. When you are done, click Play Animation.

Inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's [project](https://youtu.be/n4t_-NjY_Sg?t=179) on YouTube. 

## Features
1. Place a source and a destination on the grid.
2. Place obstacles on the grid.
3. Select a maze-generation algorithm to randomly generate obstacles on the grid.
4. 4 different algorithms to choose from.
5. 4 different themes to choose from.
